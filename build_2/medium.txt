The day was windy.
The tops of the trees curved towards the road,
 as if bowing to those departing. Waves ran alone
across the green of the vast fields. The shadows of
the clouds ran in a race with the golden stripes of lanterns.
 And the wind still did not subside, and together with them
  they flew and chased each other after other stripes of light and shadows.
